Walking is free on the Strip, but getting to Seven Magic Mountains will require a car, rideshare, or bus (research costs).\n* **Food:** This plan assumes you\'ll eat affordably, likely utilizing cheaper eateries and maybe packing some snacks/drinks.  Las Vegas can be expensive.\n* **Deals:** Look for coupons and discounts online before you go.\n* **Flexibility:** This is a *suggested* itinerary.  Feel free to adjust based on your interests and energy levels.\n\n\nRemember to replace the bracketed placeholders with actual information from your online searches.  Have a fantastic and budget-friendly trip!\n',
